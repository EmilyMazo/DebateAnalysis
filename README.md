Some quick text analysis of the first 2016 Presidential debate

This analysis is based on the NYT debate transcript: 
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/us/politics/transcript-debate.html?_r=0

"Lines" in this analysis refer to paragraphs in the debate transcript, as I have assumed that paragraphs were 
annotated as such in the NYT transcript to indicate separate statements by the speakers (in content). 

"Interruptions" were helpfully annotated by the NYT as "...". 

Please feel free to send a PR with method or visualization improvements!
