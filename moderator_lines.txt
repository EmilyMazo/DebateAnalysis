1	 Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I’m Lester Holt, anchor of “NBC Nightly News.” I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.
17	 Good luck to you.
43	 Secretary Clinton, thank you.
60	 Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?
74	 And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we’ll grow. That’s the kind of economy I want us to see again. Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You’ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you’ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?
88	 Let me interrupt just a moment, but...
92	 Back to the question, though. How do you bring back — specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?
100	 Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.
126	 Mr. Trump?
164	 Very quickly...
232	 Folks, we’re going to...
236	 We’re going to move to...
248	 Let me get you to pause right there, because we’re going to move into — we’re going to move into the next segment. We’re going to talk taxes...
262	 Well, you just opened the next segment.
268	 I’m going to give you a chance right here...
272	 ... with a new 15-minute segment...
276	 Mr. Trump, I’m going to...
280	 The next segment, we’re continuing...
284	 ... achieving prosperity...
292	 OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we’re still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.
310	 All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.
324	 This is — this is Secretary Clinton’s two minutes, please.
338	 Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton’s two minutes.
350	 Mr. Trump, we’re...
358	 Mr. Trump, we’re talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to — who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don’t Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?
368	 The IRS says an audit...
372	 ... of your taxes — you’re perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public’s right to know outweigh your personal...
384	 So it’s negotiable?
388	 Well, I’ll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?
402	 He also — he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?
408	 Mr. Trump?
430	 We’ll let you respond and we’ll move on to the next segment.
458	 Let’s let Mr. Trump...
476	 Well, we’re well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America’s direction. And let’s start by talking about race.
488	 Secretary Clinton...
496	 Secretary Clinton?
516	 Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?
526	 Mr. Trump...
530	 Please.
558	 This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...
562	 Please — 20 seconds.
566	 Please respond, then I’ve got a quick follow-up for you.
572	 Mr. Trump, let me...
580	 Mr. Trump, I...
586	 Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation’s first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?
592	 That was...
598	 I will let you respond. It’s important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You’ve continued to tell the story and question the president’s legitimacy in 2012, ’13, ’14, ’15...
602	 .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?
608	 I’m sorry. I’m just going to follow up — and I will let you respond to that, because there’s a lot there. But we’re talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...
618	 Secretary Clinton?
634	 Mr. Trump, you can respond and we’re going to move on to the next segment.
646	 Our next segment is called “Securing America.” We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who’s behind it? And how do we fight it?
662	 Your two minutes have expired.
666	 Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who’s behind it? And how do we fight it?
686	 Secretary Clinton?
698	 You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I’ll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?
706	 Secretary Clinton?
730	 Mr. Trump...
758	 Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...
762	 In 2002...
766	 My question is, since you supported it...
770	 ... why is your — why is your judgment...
774	 The record shows otherwise, but why — why was...
778	 Why was — is your judgment any...
782	 Why is your judgment better than...
790	 My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...
794	 Why is your judgment — why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton’s judgment?
802	 Secretary Clinton?
806	 Secretary Clinton?
848	 We need to move on.
852	 Our last...
856	 Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation’s longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.
872	 Your two minutes is expired.
876	 All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
890	 Your two minutes is...
894	 ... is expired.
898	 Very quickly. Twenty seconds.
902	 Mr. Trump...
906	 We have just...
910	 We have just a few final questions...
914	 Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn’t have, quote, “a presidential look.” She’s standing here right now. What did you mean by that?
918	 The quote was, “I just don’t think she has the presidential look.”
934	 We are at — we are at the final question.
940	 Very quickly, because we’re at the final question now.
966	 Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...
972	 Please very quickly.
980	 We have to move on to the final question.
986	 One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?
996	 Will you accept the outcome of the election?
1002	 All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.
